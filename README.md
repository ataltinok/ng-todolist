# Todo List

My first project using Angular.

- Add tasks by clicking the `Idle` header. 

- Click the task's text to edit it.

- Press enter or click the tick to confirm. Press the cross to cancel your edit.

- Promote or demote (arrow icons and tick) a task to move it between headers.

- Press the trash to delete a task.
